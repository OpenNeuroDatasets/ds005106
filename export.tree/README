See the linked paper for details.

The "code" directory contains all the code to reproduce the figures in the paper.
It requires fieldtrip and cosmomvpa, change the paths to these toolboxes at the top of each script (or remove the lines and add them to the path manually).

Then run the scripts to reproduce each step reported in the paper:
1. run_preprocessing.m (preprocess and epoch data)
2. run_rsa.m (makes the individual RDMs)
3. stats_rsa.m (computes the RSA correlations)
4. plot_design.m (produces Figure 1 in the paper)
5. plot_peaks.m (produces Figure 2 in the paper)
6. plot_rsa.m (produces Figure 3 in the paper)

Each script can also run standalone, as intermediate results are saved in the derivates folder
